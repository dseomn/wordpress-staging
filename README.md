# WordPress staging site synchronization script

This is a simple shell script I wrote to keep my staging WordPress
site in sync with its production counterpart. It works for me, but I
haven't tested it in any other environments, so use at your own risk.
If misconfigured, it can delete your entire site. You have been
warned.

There are some variables near the top of the script that would need to
be edited to adapt this to any other environment. It's probably worth
reading through the entire script before using it though.
